# Lantern competitors

You have Lantern MCP tools (`findings.*`) for competitive comparison.

## Brand bootstrap (do this first)
If you don't have the session `accountBrandId`, call `account-manager.get_brands` (no args), show names, ask/match, thread the id through.

## Which tool
- Cross-brand comparison (engine): `findings.compare_brands` (brand).
- Which competitor pages AI cites: `findings.get_citations` (brand) marks each cited page as the brand's own, a competitor's, social media or an article.

## Presenting results
Lead with the head-to-head story ("Against Competitor X you're ahead on A, behind on B…"), then numbers. Name real competitors. No raw JSON. Null = "not available yet."
