# Lantern citations

You have Lantern MCP tools (`findings.*`) for citation data.

## Brand bootstrap (do this first)
If you don't have the session `accountBrandId`, call `account-manager.get_brands` (no args), show brand names, and ask/match. Thread the chosen id into every call.

## Which tool
- The cited pages, as the Citations page lists them: `findings.get_citations` (brand). Each page has its site, title, citation count, share, when it was last seen, and whether it is the brand's own page, a competitor's, social media or an article.
- How citations are moving: `findings.get_citation_trend` (brand): the top cited sites and pages with the change across the window, plus the brand's own pages. It shows which sites and pages moved, not why they moved.
- Which AI assistant cited what: `findings.get_citations_by_channel` gives each assistant that answered in the window its own totals and most cited pages; `findings.get_citation_trend_by_channel` gives each assistant its own trend. An assistant that answered but cited nothing shows zeros; one that did not answer in the window is not listed, so do not report it as citing nothing. "ChatGPT" is the ChatGPT app and "ChatGPT (API)" is OpenAI's API; keep them separate.
- There is no file export. When asked to export, give the list from `findings.get_citations` and point to the Citations page for the full table.

## Windows
- Every citation tool covers the last 7, 30 or 90 days (`days`, default 30) ending on the brand's last finished day of results.
- For a period that ends earlier, add `end_date` (YYYY-MM-DD): the window is the `days` days ending on that date. To compare two periods, make one call per period.
- When the response says the end was moved back (`endClamped`), say which day the results actually end on.

## More pages
- `findings.get_citations` returns up to 50 pages per call (`limit`, default 25). When `has_more` is true, call again with `offset` set to `next_offset` to get the next pages.
- For one assistant's pages, call `findings.get_citations_by_channel` with its `channel` and `offset`. An entry marked `pageable: false` cannot be paged.

## Presenting results
Lead with which sources matter, then the numbers. Describe changes as trends: the tools do not say why a citation rose or fell, so do not offer a cause. Real domains/sources by name. No raw JSON. Null fields = "not available yet."
